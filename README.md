# Find_the_guest_BINGO

Generate printable grids for the game "Find the Guest -- BINGO". Each grid has a size of 5x5. Each entry of the grid has a sentence that describes a guest of yours or a person in general. The grids differ from one another, but they have many questions in common.

## Prerequisites
- Python (any version 3.x)
- LaTeX

## Instructions

### Step 1: Being creative time!
Think of descriptive sentences for your guests. Update the text file "guest_descriptions" and customize it according to your friends. The minimum number of descriptions is 26, but it is recommended to have more than 30 to ensure substantial differences between each grid.

### Step 2: Python time
Open your Python editor and run the file "generate_latex_files.py". You will be prompted to enter the number of cards to generate. This will generate all the LaTeX files you need and save them in your current directory. It will create one "main.tex" file and one tex file for each card/grid.

### Step 3: LaTeX time
Open your LaTeX editor and upload all the files generated by the Python code, i.e., all the .tex files. Compile the file.

### Step 4: Print time!
Export the PDF from LaTeX and send it off to the printer!

### Step 5: Game time!
Give one grid to each guest. To cross out a box, they need to write the name of the person with the description. The first to get BINGO wins the game. Consider having a trophy for added fun! Enjoy!
